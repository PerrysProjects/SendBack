Welcome to ThrowBack - a 2D open-world game developed as a school project for our computer science class. Step into a wild adventure where a professor's experiment completely messes up time itself. Imagine objects and creatures suddenly popping up in all sorts of different historical eras. Your job? Fix this crazy time mix-up by throwing everything back where it belongs.

### About the Game

ThrowBack offers players a unique experience of exploration and puzzle-solving within a procedurally generated world. As you traverse through various epochs, encountering challenges and anomalies, you'll uncover the mysteries behind the professor's failed time machine experiment.
